# HCLang
The HCLang stands for **H**ighly **C**oncurrent **Lang**uage. Therefore it's obvious that primary focus of the language is on massive parallelization, concurrency and distributed computing.

## Goals and Features
There are three primary goals forming the design of the language. It must be:
 1. highly concurrent and distributed
 2. easy, simple and expressive
 3. safe and secure

The language will have these features:
 1. powerful memory control and invariants for safety

## Development
The language is still under heavy development, details are in [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md) document.

## Documentation
To Be Added

## License
